Filter for reads from taxa of interest using Kraken2/Centrifuge classification results.


* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
* Documentation: https://filter-classified-reads.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Filter for union of reads classified to taxa of interest Kraken2_ and Centrifuge_ (by default filter for Viral reads (taxid=10239))
* Output unclassified reads along with reads from taxa of interest *or* exlude them with `--exclude-unclassified`
* seqtk_ for quickly filtering reads and pbgzip_ for parallel block Gzip compression of output reads (recommended that these dependencies are installed with Conda_)

Usage
-----

Paired-end reads with classification results by both Kraken2_ and Centrifuge_

.. code-block::

    filter_classified_reads -i /path/to/reads/R1.fq \
                            -I /path/to/reads/R2.fq \
                            -o  /path/to/reads/R1.filtered.fq.gz \
                            -O  /path/to/reads/R2.filtered.fq.gz \
                            -k  /path/to/kraken2/results.tsv \
                            -K  /path/to/kraken2/kreport.tsv \
                            -c  /path/to/centrifuge/results.tsv \
                            -C  /path/to/centrifuge/kreport.tsv \


Using test data in `tests/data/`:

.. code-block::

    $ filter_classified_reads -i tests/data/SRR8207674_1.viral_unclassified.seqtk_seed42_n10000.fastq.gz \
                              -I tests/data/SRR8207674_2.viral_unclassified.seqtk_seed42_n10000.fastq.gz \
                              -o r1.fq.gz \
                              -O r2.fq.gz \
                              -k tests/data/SRR8207674-kraken2_results.tsv \
                              -K tests/data/SRR8207674-kraken2_report.tsv \
                              -c tests/data/SRR8207674-centrifuge_results.tsv \
                              -C tests/data/SRR8207674-centrifuge_kreport.tsv
